# Movie-Trailer-Website-Project

Project 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. This project demonstates the ability to use object oriented classes generated in python to build a static html webpage. This webpage displays an array of some of my favorite movies with links to their respective trailers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 2  

### Installation & Deployment

Download the project zip file to you computer and unzip the file. Or clone this repository to your desktop.
Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).
Navigate to the project directory and type in the following command:

Your default browser should launch a new tab displaying the movie trailer website.
